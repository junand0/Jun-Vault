## The Structure of S-eq

>For a given state function $\psi$ which contains information of the system

$\implies i.e. \hat{H}\psi=E\psi$

following wave 방향축으로 op 적용하면 following wave가 흔들리지 않는다.
즉 $\ket{f}$ symmetry axis로 eigenvector를 잡고 op 적용하면 eigenvector 방향의 vector는 길이만 변하고 방향은 바뀌지 않음

when making operation(measurement) that is applying operator, the system $\psi$ reduces to the eigen space of such operator thus its state changes in terms of other non-commuting operation
*meaning that uncertanty between non-commuting operators*

we should choose eigen functions from B.C. and express $\psi$ with fourier expansion using eigen functions
