## Performance Factors
$T_{wall-clock}=T_{cyc}\times CPI\times \#\ of\ inst$
Tcyc = max{combinational delay}
\# of inst is determined by ISA and compilers
## ILP : Inst - Level Parallelism
- Measure of the amount of inter - dependencies btw insts
- Average ILP$=\frac{\#\ of\ inst}{\#\ of\ cycle\ required}$

>ILP=1 ; must execute serially

>ILP=3 ; can execute at the same time parallelly

- data forwarding btw ALU
- No double data memory resources
	- parallel한 두 inst가 동시에 memory data access를 하는 경우가 드물 때 가능
### Superscalar vs Superpipelined
![400](https://i.imgur.com/052ILMm.png)

## Limitation of In-Order Pipelines
![500](https://i.imgur.com/72HMO2h.png)
- As Sperscalar and Superpipeline degree increase, $N\times M$ become greater than average distance btw dependent insts
- Even with full forwarding pipeline cannot be full because of dependency stall (data hazard)
![500](https://i.imgur.com/UUboXZe.png)
- "mulf" stalls due to RAW hazard by dependency with "addf" (d*, d*)
	- "addf" data forwarding to "mulf" in last E+
- "subf " stalls, because cannot proceed in Decoding (p*, p*)
	- "mulf" is still in Decoding
## True Dependency
![400](https://i.imgur.com/7t2COBC.png)
- Can remove RAW hazard with extra resources
- *WAR* and *WAW* dependencies are *false* dependencies
	- Using more registers, WAR and WAW are eliminated completely
### Register Renaming

>As increasing distance btw dependent insts, remove dependency
>ILP = 2 with changed EX order (superpipelining)

![300](https://i.imgur.com/pS4WySP.png)
>ILP = 2 with multiple execution (superscalar)

#### Hardware Register Renaming
![400](https://i.imgur.com/AFQ8M33.png)
- When issuing an inst who updates *architecture register* "rd"
	- Allocate an unused rename *physical register* "px"
	- Record binding from "rd" to "px"
	- *rename physical register* is *uArchitecture* $\to$ compiler cannot use it and also doesn't know about it
- *WAR* and *WAW* dependencies are "False"
	- dependency on name/location not data
	- using extra register, WAR and WAW are resolved
	- RAW still remains

- output은 free register allocate
- r1에 WB하는 inst가 pipeline을 완전히 빠져나갈 때 p4를 free register로 return 가능
	- 이전에 mapping했던 p 값을 저장해놔야 한다.
		- p7을 새롭게 allocate하면서 p4 mapping history를 저장
	- r1에 WB하면 이후로 p4를 사용하지 않을 것이지만 branch misprediction or exception handling에 의해 r1에 WB하는 inst가 flush 될 수 있기 때문에 pipeline을 완전히 빠져나간 뒤에 free return 가능
	- OoO로 inst가 pipeline을 빠져나가면 안됨
	- OoO로 Ex만 하고 겉으로는 sequential하게 하나씩 pipeline을 빠져나감
		- OoO must not be exposed to the outside of CPU
- independent instructions can issue regardless of  other insts and start their own executions
	- *OoO execution*

## Typical Out-of-Order Superscalar CPU
![500](https://i.imgur.com/3jSRf2m.png)
>사용할 register(operands)가 준비되었는지 매 cycle마다 확인하고 준비가 되었으면 issue buffer에서 issue 된다.

![600](https://i.imgur.com/5WLEQ77.png)

- Issue insts OoO
	- find inst whose operands are all ready and issue
	- ISQ check the outcomes of newly completed insts whether it is matched with operands of pending insts in ISQ considering *RAW dependency*
- Must remember the origin order of program
	- Sequential and Atomic semantics of architecture
	- if there are branch misprediction or interrupt handling fail then must restore the previous state
	- *Reorder Buffer (ROB)* remembers the order
### ROB
- Instructions must enter and leave the pipeline sequentially in order i.t.o. outside CPU view
- Resorts all insts on exit to appear as if complete in order
- Supports *precise & transparent* exception for any in-flight inst
	- To keep sequential semantic
	- control transfer to exception handler after retiring all of older insts from pipeline
	- flush all of younger insts from pipeline

### LSQ : Load/Store Queue
![500](https://i.imgur.com/zV0SlVx.png)
- not allow instructions change the Data Memory *in the pipeline*
- When complete the store inst operation, write the stored values to LSQ
- When store inst retires, the head of LSQ is written to DM
- Forwad value from LSQ if the addr matches
### Control Dependency hurt ILP
- branch misprediction makes ISQ and ROB not filled 100%
#### Branch prediction in Superscalar / OoO
- The penalty of misprediction increases
	- increasing \# of mispredicted insts until the outcome of predicted branch is known
	- Recovery from a misprediction gets very complicated
		- restore the original value of registers updated by mispredicted branch
		- restore renaming table & free registers(free list) to origin state
		- *Speculative branch prediction table* updates and restore if wrong
#### Speculative Execution in SS/OoO
- Instructions after a predicted branch are speculative
	- need a mechanism to undo their effects when misprediction detected
- Must maintain separate copies of
	- *In-Order State* : a "check point state" up to just before the first speculated inst
	- *Speculative State* : all state changes after check point, possibly multiple predicted branches
- *Commit*
	- Admit known to be "good speculative state" changes into the "in order state"
	- Remove completed insts from the ROB
- *Rewind*
	- discard all of the speculative state
	- a lot of non-branch insts can be also *speculative* insts
		- If the check point branch inst is mispredicted, then all of younger inst after the check point have to be flushed and restore to check point state
#### Superscalar + OoO Execution
- In order Fetch
- In order Decode
	- register renaming
- Out of Order issue & complete
	- Issued from ISQ & LSQ
	- Operand obtained from
		- Architectural register
		- Physical register or ROB entries (two ways of register renaming)
	- Update physical registers or ROB entries
- Out of Order complete *(not retire)*
- *In order commit*
	- physical register written to architecture register in order
	- sequential & atomic semantics maintain i.t.o. user view
## Moder OoO mechanisms
- handle precise state and speculation
- handle mem dependencies in more advanced ways
#### P6 - style execution (Intel Pentium Pro)
- ROB works like ;  *internal register file + issue queue*
	- Map table : Register $\to$ Archi register or *ROB entry*
	- Completed value in ROB indicated by map table
		- ROB works like *temporal registers* by storing values
		- ROB entry has a bit to tell whether result is *pending or completed*
	- The oldest completed insts written to a seprate Archi RF *(PVS)*
	- *No free list required* because the tail of ROB is the first free register
	- *ROB is not scalable*
- *Separate "architecture registers"* for program visible state

#### R10k - style execution (MIPS R10000)
- ROB remembers *only the program order* (not value)
- Big physical register files (implicitly include archi RF)
	- Physical register file holds all values $\to$ *No Archi register file*
	- \# phtysical regisers = \# archi regisers + \# temporal registers
	- Map all archi register to physical register
	- Arch register file can be *extracted* from physical register file
- Free list must keep a track of unallocated physical regisers
	- becuase of full mapping
	- 동일한 logical register에 중복 mapping 된 physical regiser의 inst가 pipeline을 빠져나가면 free return 가능 $\to$ track to free list this
